This project is a simple music player web application that allows users to play and switch between different audio tracks. The web application consists of a player interface that displays the album art, track name, artist name, album name, and control buttons for play/pause, skip, and volume. There is also a playlist section that displays a list of available tracks for the user to choose from.

The music player is powered by the Howler.js library, which provides an easy-to-use interface for loading and playing audio files. The playlist is implemented using JavaScript event listeners that respond to clicks on the playlist items and update the player with the corresponding audio file.

When a user clicks on a track in the playlist, the application loads the audio file and updates the player with the corresponding track name, artist name, and album name. The play/pause button toggles between play and pause modes, while the skip button skips to the next track in the playlist. The volume slider allows the user to adjust the volume of the currently playing track.

This music player application provides a simple and intuitive interface for playing and switching between different audio tracks. It is a good starting point for anyone looking to build a more advanced music player application or to learn how to use the Howler.js library.
